# jupyter-stdlib-browser-kernel

> Run an in-browser JavaScript Jupyter kernel.

<!-- Section to include introductory text. Make sure to keep an empty line after the intro `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="intro">

## Prerequisites

Installing and running the kernel **requires** the following prerequisites:

-   [Node.js][node-js]: JavaScript runtime (preferably the latest LTS version)
-   [npm][npm]: package manager
-   [Jupyter][jupyter]: notebook environment and runtime

[Node.js][node-js] and [npm][npm] are only needed during the installation sequence.

## Installation

To install the Jupyter kernel, navigate to the user directory for installing Jupyter kernels

```bash
$ cd $(jupyter --data-dir)/kernels
```

If the directory does not already exist, create the `kernels` folder

```bash
$ $(jupyter --data-dir)/kernels
```

and then navigate to the created directory. Once in the `kernels` directory, clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stdlib-js/jupyter-stdlib-browser-kernel.git
```

Navigate to the newly created directory

```bash
$ cd jupyter-stdlib-browser-kernel
```

and run the install sequence

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Navigate to the directory from which you want to load, save, and/or edit notebooks

```bash
$ cd /path/to/directory
```

and launch Jupyter notebook

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

Once opened, select the `JavaScript (in-browser)` notebook kernel.

## Development

To acquire the source code, first navigate to the parent directory into which you want to clone the git repository

```bash
$ cd /path/to/parent/destination/directory
```

Next, clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stdlib-js/jupyter-stdlib-browser-kernel.git
```

To install as a Jupyter kernel, from the parent directory of the cloned repository, run

```bash
$ jupyter kernelspec install ./jupyter-stdlib-browser-kernel --user
```

The previous command should be run anytime changes are made to local repository files.
